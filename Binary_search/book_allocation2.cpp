// Ayush is studying for ninjatest which will be held after 'N' days, And to score good marks he has to study 'M' chapters and the ith chapter requires TIME[i] seconds to study. The day in Ayush’s world has 100^100 seconds. There are some rules that are followed by Ayush while studying.
// 1. He reads the chapter in a sequential order, i.e. he studies i+1th chapter only after he studies ith chapter.
// 2. If he starts some chapter on a particular day he completes it that day itself.
// 3. He wants to distribute his workload over 'N' days, so he wants to minimize the maximum amount of time he studies in a day.
// Your task is to find out the minimal value of the maximum amount of time for which Ayush studies in a day, in order to complete all the 'M' chapters in no more than 'N' days.
// For example
// if Ayush want to study 6 chapters in 3 days and the time that each chapter requires is as follows:
// Chapter 1 = 30
// Chapter 2 = 20
// Chapter 3 = 10
// Chapter 4 = 40
// Chapter 5 = 5
// Chapter 6 = 45
// Then he will study the chapters in the following order 
// | day 1 : 1 , 2 | day 2 : 3 , 4 | day 3 : 5 , 6 |
// Here we can see that he study chapters in sequential order and the maximum time to study on a day is 50, which is the minimum possible in this case.
// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
// Constraints:
// 1 <= T <= 10
// 1 <= N , M <= 10 ^ 4
// 1 <= TIME[i] <= 10 ^ 9 
// It is considered that there are infinite seconds in a day, on the planet where Ayush lives.
// Time limit: 1 sec.
